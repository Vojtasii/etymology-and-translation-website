Etymological dictionary and a basic translator
==============================================
Project purpose
---------------
The aim of this project is to create a website with a simple translator where
you can search a word for its etymology. This website will then be presented as
my Maturita project at Gymnázium Nad Álejí. Maturita is the final exam at the
end of highschool in Czechia.

Planned Features
----------------
- Keyword(s) search function. Correction for misspellings based on a modified
Damerau-Levenshtein algortihm. Search in all categories, e.g. etymology.
- translation of keywords into Czech or other languages
- import of data from existing dictionaries, automatic updates
- easy to use GUI

Ownership
---------
Because this is a school project, the school is the owner.
